VMCONTEXT CHANGES FOR DEBAIN CONTEXT SCRIPT

The init order of vmcontext needs to be changed to start after openibd. If it starts before openibd only Ethernet interfaces will be configured.

To fix this edit /etc/init.d/vmcontext and change:
 Should-Start:      networking
to
 Should-Start:      openibd

Then run:
update-rc.d -f vmcontext remove
update-rc.d vmcontext defaults

The network will now be configured after the IB driver has been loaded.

NOTE: For this to work the IB OFED must be installed in the VM even if you do NOT attach an IB interface.
